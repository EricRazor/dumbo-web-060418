# Functional JavaScript

## Objectives

- Identify functions as objects. In particular, they will be able to:
  - Assign functions to variables
  - Pass functions as arguments to functions
  - Return functions inside functions
- Explain what an IIFEs is and why one might use it

## Notes

- First-class objects
  - Store it in a variable
  - Pass it as an argument
- First-class functions
  - Call them
  - Store it in a variable
  - Pass it as an argument
- Higher-order functions

  - Take functions as arguments
    - Array.prototype.forEach
    - Array.prototype.map
    - Array.prototype.reduce
    - Array.prototype.filter
    - fi.sortBy
    - fi.filter
  - Return functions: if you have some code that you need to repeat

- Currying: executing functions that return functions back to back
- IIFE & the Module pattern
- Prototype
  - all the inherited properties for that object
