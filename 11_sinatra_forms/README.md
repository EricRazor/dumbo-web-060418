# Internet and MVC

## Objectives

* Discuss how Sinatra handles forms
* Highlight the fact a form has two major routes: one to retrieve the form and another for where the form should go
* Understand the other actions we do in standard web applications (`new`, `create`, `edit`, `update`, `delete`)
* Understand how params can help create objects using mass assignment
* Understand that the browser only understands `GET` and `POST` requests until we use the method override
